RECOMMENDATIONS
The following receommendations wwas made based on the analysis: 

There should be more mental health resources especially on social media to ensure inclusivity across all genders for maximum outreach.

Provision of more public health systems and expansion of counselling services generally as this would help to reduce the suicide rates.

Partnerships with Facebook and Twitter is encouraged as they would use this medium to generally promote mental health campaigns and sensitizations across the world.

The boy child should also be given attention too, and trained to share problems bothering them so as to help them learn how to open up when they fully become men in the future.

Mental health courses and programs should be organized and introduced more so as to sensitize and teach the people especially youths on the importance of protecting their mental health generally and ways to handle mental health issues.
